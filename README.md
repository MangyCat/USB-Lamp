# USB-Lamp
## Lamp with PCB edge connector.
- This is an PCB USB keychain I made in a couple hours in KiCAD 9, I made the keychain because i really wanted something as a torch to be attached to something for example a charging brick or a powerbank, added a hole in the PCB so it's an keychain.

BOM:
- 3528 SMD Led = Preowned
- PCB = 5pcs, 3.60 usd
- 220 ohm resistor = preowned

USBLamp.zip is the production gerber files.
